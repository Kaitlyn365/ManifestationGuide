# Manifestation Guide
PART I - 3D IS COMPLETELY FAKE
!!!!!THIS REALIZATION MAY TRIGGER DISSOCIATION (IT DID FOR ME) SO BEWARE BEFORE READING ON!!!!!

Also this realization is a little weird, just try not to overcomplicate it

I'm pretty sure you already have a good gist on what Law Of Assumption is so we will skip to the facts.


Look around you, what you see is called your 3D, now close your eyes, imagine something, this could be your paracosm or a gorey scene or something as simple as an apple or pencil. This right here is your 4D.


Don’t worry if you have aphantasia you still have a 4D, a 4D is simply an inner world but it doesn't necessarily mean imagination. You can still manifest without visualization.


Now back to the 3D being fake, HOW is it fake if i can see it? Because you can change it! Let me elaborate.


You can easily change your 3D just by changing your assumptions, once you do, your 3D will too. Again this is such a weird realization I know.


PART II - PAY ATTENTION TO 4D
Why are you even paying attention to your 3D? Everything comes from inside first! If your 3D is fake and you need to change your assumptions to change your reality, then that means everything you don't need to look in the 3D for ANYTHING, you need to look in the 4D for everything!For Example:Sam wants to manifest blades for s/h, so he affirms “I have an impossibly sharp blade” and he goes about his day, every single time he thinks about his blade. He thinks “I already have a blade, it's so sharp”. He did this even when his reality showed him otherwise, he kept affirming even when he started to have anxiety and think that his desire wouldn't come. He reminded himself ‘what i see is not real, it never was’ and he closed his eyes and visualized himself using his blade, this made him happy and he kept affirming, soon he manifested a blade.


What did Sam do?

He affirmed
He persisted
He reminded himself of his 3D being fake
He ignored his 3D

Yes he did also visualize but thats a tool, it’s not necessary


Also, be delusional if you want! It helps to strut around knowing your desire is yours already doesn't it? (I love being delulu personally)


PART III - REALIZING YOUR POWER
STOP EVERYTHING AND FUCKING READ


YOU have the ability to become a mythical species

YOU have the ability to revise your whole life to be exactly how you desire

YOU have the ability to shift to your desired reality tonight

YOU have the power!Something is not going right? BAM now it is

Something bothering you? BAM it's gone!

SOMEONE BOTHERING AND HURTING YOU! BAM THEY NEVER EXISTED

NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE!


I kid you not people have resurrected dead people and animals


You know when Kanye West got exposed, SOMEONE MANIFESTED THAT! I AM BEING DEAD FUCKING SERIOUS.


What does this mean? It means you CAN! END. OF. STORY.


PART IV - MANIFESTATION IS INSTANT
You want a lighter to set that church on fire? Once you assume it to be true its fucking true alright! Like literally instantly true! Your reality is changing itself behind the scenes to fit that new assumption you have. But why even pay attention to your 3D? The millisecond you want them to text you or want a yandere or want 150k robux or want a 150M in your bank acc or want that superpower, and accept the fact that you have it

PART V - GO!
No like im being dead fucking serious…go right now! Manifest anything that comes to mind, why? Because soon you'll be on your last couple days, thinking about this, you'll be like


“Why the hell didn't my younger self just go for it?’


You found the law for a reason, it's literally the key to everything you could ever want!


I would suggest deleting social media and just manifesting, hell i think i'll delete tumblr and do so.


You can manifest whatever you want, so why should it matter what anyone, or anything says? Does it make you happy to manifest it? Then GO!


The reason why this was so short is because there is really nothing much else to say…you have the knowledge and tools…seriously! JUST GO!


It’s the story of your life, not theirs


The End
